## Use the widget on your web site

You can use the widget on your web site. The example page linked above has instructions.

## Access to audio files

If you run the Ark Player on a server of your own, you need to ask me to authorize your origin (CORS) to access the audio files.

## Developer instructions

Clone this repo and run `npm install`. The player's JavaScript and scss sources are in `widgets/arkPlayer`. To compile, run `npm libs`.

The rest of this repo is tool chain, demo and legacy. You shouldn't need to deal with it.
